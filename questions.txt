Voltage is:
Thepotential energy, stored in the form of an electric charge imbalance that is capable of provoking electrons to
flow through a conductor, it can be expressed as a term called voltage, which technically is a measure of 
potential energy per unit charge of electrons, or something a physicist would call specific potential energy.

Resistance is:
As the electrons work their way through the thin metal filament of the lamp, they encounter more opposition to 
motion than they typically would in a thick piece of wire. This opposition to electric current depends on the 
type of material, its cross-sectional area, and its temperature. It is technically known as resistance. 
(It can be said that conductors have low resistance and insulators have very high resistance.)

A Short Circut is considered a closed circut

An open circuit is one where the continuity has been broken by an interruption in the path for electrons to flow.
A closed circuit is one that is complete, with good continuity throughout.

Yes I did BUT my PC required a driver DL and the Feather 32u4 was not in the driver packet so we will see if it 
works in the morning.
